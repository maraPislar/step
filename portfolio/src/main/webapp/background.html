        <h4 class="title">Where I live</h4>
        <p>
            My home town is called Radauti.
            Radauti is a small town from the North of Romania and is
            very popular in the country because of a soup called "
            Ciorba Radauteana". This soup takes over its name because it 
            was invented by an old lady in town. Now it is served in 
            most of the restaurants all around the country.

        <h4 class="title">Family</h4>
        <p>
            I was born on the 25th of July in 2000 in a loving family.
            We love to go on trips together, especially hiking.
            I have two other sisters, me being the middle child. Miruna
            is 24 and Sofia is 5 at the moment. It's very hard to
            take a clear picture with Sofia, she is not 
            very patient.<br><br>
            Fun fact: there were many times in my life when
            people thought me and Miruna were twins, when in fact we are
            4 years apart.
