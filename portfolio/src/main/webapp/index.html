      <h3>Background</h3>
      <h4>Residence</h4>
      <p>
          Since I was a small kid, I have lived in Radauti. 
          Radauti is a small town from the North of Romania which is
          very popular in the country because of a soup. This soup
          takes over its name ("Ciorba Radauteana") because it 
          was invented here and is served in most of the restaurants 
          all around the country. <! -- Insert picture with town -->

      <h4>Family</h4>
      <p>
          I was born on the 25th of July in 2000 in a loving family.
          I have two other sisters, me being the middle child. Miruna
          is 24 and Sofia is 5 at the moment. We love to spend time
          together. <! -- Insert picture with sisters -->

      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p>

              <li>First kind of education was from my parents.</li>
              <li>2015-2019: "Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi" College, Radauti;
                  I followed the Mathematics and Informatics profile. </li>
              <li>2019-Present: University of Southampton, United Kingdom;

      </p>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <h4>Tetris</h4>
      <p>I created the game Tetris using HTML5 and JavaScript. 
          The project wa screated for knowledge purposes as well as for
          others amusament.
      </p>
      <h4>School Simulation</h4>
      <p>
          This project was created to simulate a school: add courses,
          teachers, certificates, etc. Courses have a number of free spaces
          for students, as well as days in which they can be completed (be 
          aware of weekends).
          Teachers have job specifications that permit them to teach a course.
          Students can get certificates when they complete a course and can't
          enroll in courses where they already have certificates. 
          When a students has certificates for all courses, he is no 
          longer a student.
          The aim is for all the students to finish all courses.
          Programming language used: Java.
      </p>
      <h4>Mathdoku</h4>
      <p>Mathdoku, also known as KenKen, is a game that uses
          math to be solved. For more details about the rules
          of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen"
          target="_blank">
          click here</a>. It becomes more and more difficult depending
          on the size of the board.
          I created this game using Java and JavaFx to also interract
          with the user.
