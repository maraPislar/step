      <h4>Tetris</h4>
        <p>I created the game Tetris using HTML5 and JavaScript. 
            The project was created for knowledge purposes as well as for
            others amusament.
        </p>
        <h4>School Simulation</h4>
        <p>
            This project was created to simulate a school: add courses,
            teachers, certificates, etc. Courses have a number of free spaces
            for students, as well as days in which they can be completed (be 
            aware of weekends).
            Teachers have job specifications that permit them to teach a course.
            Students can get certificates when they complete a course and can't
            enroll in courses where they already have certificates. 
            When a student has certificates for all the courses, he
            finishes the school.
            The aim is for all the students to finish all courses.
            Programming language used: Java.

        <h4>Mathdoku</h4>
        <p>Mathdoku, also known as KenKen, is a game that uses
            math to be solved. For more details about the rules
            of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen"

            click here</a>. It becomes more and more difficult depending
            on the size of the board.
            I created this game using Java and JavaFx to also interract
            with the user.
