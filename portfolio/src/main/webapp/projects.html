        <h4 class="title">Tetris</h4>
        <p>
            I created the game Tetris using HTML5 and JavaScript. 
            The project was created for knowledge purposes as well as for
            others amusament. If you don't know what tetris is, 
            you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris" 
                    targer="_blank">click this</a>. 
            The code helped me understand some Physics principles in
            coding by simulating movement and rotation. You can
            find the code on my Github account (link in the menu from the
            right).<br><br>
            This is how it turned out: <br><br>

        <h4 class="title">School Simulation</h4>
        <p>
            This project was created to simulate a school: add courses,
            teachers, certificates, etc. Courses have a number of free spaces
            for students, as well as days in which they can be completed (be 
            aware of weekends). <br>
            Teachers have job specifications that permit them to teach a course.
            Students can get certificates when they complete a course and can't
            enroll in courses where they already have certificates. 
            When a student has certificates for all the courses, he
            finishes school. <br><br>
            The aim is for all the students to finish all courses.
            Programming language used: Java.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title">Mathdoku</h4>
        <p>
            Mathdoku, also known as KenKen, is a game that uses
            math to be solved. For more details about the rules
            of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen"
            target="_blank">
            click here</a>. It becomes more and more difficult depending
            on the size of the board.
            I created this game using Java and JavaFx to also interract
            with the user.<br><br>
            This is how this one turned out:<br>

            <img src="/images/enabled.png" class="some-image">

            <br> <br>

            When the help option is enabled, if a row/column has 
            numbers that repeat themselves, it highlights the
            whole row/column with yellow; if a cage is filled with
            numbers that don't respect the result, then it highlights
            the cage with red. <br><br>
            If the user wins, all the entries continue to color
            themselves and it gives the impression of a disco ball.
            The code for this one is not avilable because I commited
            on the git from my university.

        <h4 class="title">Coronavirus Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            This project was realised with SQL and bash script. The idea was
            to analyse an official CSV file with data refering to current
            coronavirus cases in each country, per day. Using SQL the
            data was extracted and with bash script it was plotted.
            <br><br>
            This is how the plot looks:<br>
